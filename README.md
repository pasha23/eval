This is a pedagogical lisp interpreter inspired by descriptions in John Allen's book _The_Anatomy_Of_Lisp_.  

It is not conformant with modern practice.  

There is no way it will ever compete with some of the great work out there.

I could point you to some excellent implementations if you care about that.

It's more of a reconstruction of classic practice in a more modern style.  We use lists for everything.  We use recursion for everything.

It only took a few hours to write.  It just had to come out.  

To make it better would not be all that successful and would obscure its essence.  

This would really benefit from tail call optimization.

Well, we could make it a little better by fixing a few things.  We could achieve more fidelity to ancient work.
Some examples would be nice.  But there is so much missing.  Adding those things would be so much bloat.

There are needless deviations from classic forms that could be rectified with a little research.

Some things are here just because I wanted to learn about them, like the use of libunwind.

Other things might be really useful.  We illustrate how to use a protection stack to make garbage collection feasible.

On the other hand, the code as it is is an aesthetic expression of a way of doing things and a kind of paean to an historical practice.  And there is nothing wrong with that.
